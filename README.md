## Overview

This was a fair challenge that helped me exercise my newly learnt Javascript concepts such as making API calls, visualizing and processsing the data from an API and also responsive design. I built the app from scratch with no figma files so the measurements may not exactly much the design from frontend mentor.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

I first setup the project repo on gitHub and analysed the designed and what was the most appropriate css unit to use on the project. Then i mapped it out on paper and made a plan on how to approach the coding challenge and also noted down the parts i thought i wasn't familiar with and then i started coding.

On various occasions I'd stop and learn or review a concept and intergrate it in the project.

Ofcourse I never forgot to play music and drink water while i was coding.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Rest APIs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rest-api-introduction/) - API tutorial
- Javascript

### What I learned

I really didn't learn alot as most of the concepts I used in this project needed rather revision than learning from scratch. I was just happy to practice my coding as a habit i am creating.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) - The frontend career path has taught me almost 70% of everything I know about frontend developing. Their responsive, in-depth tutorials are really helpful.
